# Simple_Date_Manipulator_in_C
Date Management in C: Advance, Reverse, and Calculate Differences Between Dates with Robust Input Validation. Great for learning structs, functions, and date algorithms.

Description

This project started as a computer lab assignment to add or subtract a single day from a given date and compare the two dates that was put in by the user. I have enhanced it to allow the user to:

Move forward or backward by any number of days.

Compares the two dates by giving how many days, months and years in between.

Interact dynamically, adjusting dates as needed.

Enjoy a more polished and user-friendly experience.


It demonstrates flexibility in date manipulation and improves usability beyond the original assignment.

Features

User-driven interaction to control date changes.

Polished output and easy-to-use interface.
